 * with zero uPnL no matter what collateral it actually holds. A long whose
 * collateral had been drained from $7.50 to $3.50 by a stretch of positive
 * funding therefore rendered 2.00 in full green - a full bar and "$3.75 of
 * room" - while the chain computed 3.50/3.75 = 0.93 and the keeper's next pass
 * liquidated it. The user was liquidated off a screen showing maximum health.
 *
 * The collateral is still not trusted OUTRIGHT, which is what the discarded
 * comment was protecting: both rows' collateral accumulates from the same
 * `filled_margin`, and fills stamped under the pre-fix (1000x) margin scale
 * make it read in the hundreds, pushing health into the hundreds and the liq
 * price negative. So it is used as a conservative FLOOR - min(collateral,
 * derived). A legacy-inflated value falls back to the derived estimate exactly
 * as before, while a funding-drained value (always smaller) is honoured, and
 * neither can overstate health.
 *
 * Accrued funding IS subtracted, which is the other half of the same failure.
 * The collateral floor above only covers the case where something has already
 * realized the debt out of collateral (claim_funding, or settle_trades on the
 * next fill); between those the debt is unclaimed, collateral is untouched, and
 * the position read healthier here than the keeper computed it. `fundingRate`
 * is (Market.cumulative_funding_index - Position.funding_index_snapshot) /
 * FUNDING_SCALE - the dimensionless rate compute_funding_payment (funding.rs:
 * 66-101) applies to SIGNED notional, so a long pays a positive delta and a
 * short receives it, and it is subtracted from the numerator exactly as
 * liquidate_position.rs:153-158 does (it passes -funding_payment into
 * compute_health_factor, which adds it).
 *
 * `mark` is the reference price (oracle first), not Market::last_mark_price, so
 * these figures track the market rather than the crank - deliberate, and the
 * same choice the Mark column beside them makes.
 *
 * Inputs are human units: sizeSol (SOL), entry/mark (USD), collateral (USD).

/**
 * `mark` is nullable ON PURPOSE. It used to be called with `reference ?? 0`,
 * and at mark = 0 the uPnL term below inverts: a SHORT reads
 * uPnl = +entry*size, health enormous, and HealthCell paints a full green bar
 * on a position the program may consider liquidatable. A LONG reads the
 * mirror image and looks about to be liquidated. Both are fabrications from a
 * price the rest of this component correctly refuses to quote — the Mark
 * column two cells left already renders "—" in the same state.
