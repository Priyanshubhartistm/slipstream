/**
 * One place that turns any failure into a sentence a trader can act on.
 *
 * There used to be two half-decoders that never met:
 *
 *   humanizeError      (use-session.ts, module-private) — knew about wallet and
 *                      RPC failures, knew NOTHING about program error codes.
 *   decodeProgramError (order-form.tsx, module-private) — knew all 56 program
 *                      error names, knew nothing about wallet or network
 *                      failures.
 *
 * Neither was exported, so the five most frequent error surfaces in the app —
 * Close, Flatten, Cancel order, Set SL/TP, Cancel trigger — reached neither and
 * printed the raw exception.
 *
 * Worse, the program-code decoder could not read its own codebase's errors.
 * lib/confirm.ts throws `Transaction failed: {"InstructionError":[0,{"Custom":6152}]}`
 * and the two patterns it matched were `custom program error: 0x…` and
 * `Custom(…)` — neither matches JSON's `"Custom":6152`. So every on-chain
 * failure that arrived through confirmSignature bypassed the entire table.
