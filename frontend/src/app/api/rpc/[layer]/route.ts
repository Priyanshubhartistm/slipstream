// Same-origin JSON-RPC proxy for the Solana base layer and the MagicBlock ER.
//
// WHY: the browser calling the MagicBlock ER (https://devnet.magicblock.app)
// directly fails with "TypeError: Failed to fetch" / "failed to get recent
// blockhash" — a cross-origin (CORS) / browser-network issue. Node processes
// (bots, keepers) reach the ER fine, which is why they trade but the browser
// can't even fetch a blockhash. Routing RPC through this same-origin API route
// removes CORS entirely (the request is same-origin to the Next app; the server
// forwards it to the upstream RPC) and lets us add a small retry for the ER's
// occasional flakiness.
//
// Routes:
//   POST /api/rpc/base  -> https://api.devnet.solana.com  (base layer)
//   POST /api/rpc/er    -> https://devnet.magicblock.app   (Ephemeral Rollup)
//
// Override upstreams via BASE_RPC_UPSTREAM / ER_RPC_UPSTREAM (server env).

 * NOT a batch: it is one call carrying an array of keys — see below.)
