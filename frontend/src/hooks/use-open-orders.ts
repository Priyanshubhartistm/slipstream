 * filled yet — distinct from settled L1 Positions. Each order slot carries its
 * owner, so we filter the active slots to the connected wallet.
 *
 * This used to be a THIRD independent 2s poller on the 626,736-byte OrderBook
 * account, on top of useOrderBook's shared one and useErPosition's — a second
 * 836 KB every 2s to display at most twenty rows, of which it read the first
 * 29% and threw the rest away. It now selects from the one shared decode.
 * The ER-then-base fallback and the keep-last-good-on-error semantics it used
 * to implement itself are identical in useOrderBook + useSharedSource, so
 * nothing was lost with the poller.

  // "unavailable" is the second one — it is useOrderBook's word for unreachable
  // WITH nothing cached; "stale" still holds a last-good book, and "loading"
  // and "empty" are answers.
  //
  // (The `refresh` this used to return was a documented no-op — the book is the
  // shared 2s poller's and one subscriber cannot make it tick early — so it was
  // deleted along with its only call site in open-orders.tsx. A cancelled row
  // still clears on the next shared poll, within 2s.)
  // "loading" is the third one: the shared book read has not resolved, so an
  // empty list is not an answer either. Forwarded rather than folded into
  // `error`, so the panel can say "checking" instead of "none" or "broken".
