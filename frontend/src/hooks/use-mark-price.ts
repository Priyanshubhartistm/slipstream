/**
 * One answer to "what price should this surface use, and can it be trusted?"
 *
 * Six surfaces read `market.lastMarkPrice` and five of them rendered it as if
 * it were live (S13-02, S13-03, S13-04, S9-X02, S3-X03). Only `market-bar.tsx`
 * treated it carefully, and it stated the invariant while doing so: "if the
 * keepers stop, mark freezes while the market does not, and showing the frozen
 * number as 'the price' would be a lie." That treatment is lifted here so every
 * surface gets it, rather than each re-deriving it or forgetting to.
 *
 * Two independent staleness signals, because they fail in different ways:
 *
 *   - `stampStale` is the program's own gate (`Market::is_mark_price_fresh`),
 *     read from the `mark_price_minute` stamp that S6-01 restored to the
 *     decoders. It needs nothing but the market account: if it says stale,
 *     `close_position` and `place_order` will refuse this mark. It matches the
 *     chain everywhere except the far half of the minute ring, which it reads
 *     as a client clock running behind rather than a 22-45 day old mark - see
 *     the CEILING note in `markPriceAgeMins`.
 *   - `divergenceStale` compares the mark to the live oracle. It catches a mark
 *     that is being stamped but is wrong, which the stamp alone cannot see, but
 *     it says nothing at all when the oracle stream is down.
 *
 * `reference` is what price math should actually use: the oracle when it is
 * available, otherwise a mark the program itself would still accept, otherwise
 * null. Null means "do not quote a price" - not "fall back to the frozen one".

  //   - `reference` fell back to a spot that stopped updating minutes ago, and

  //     false negative exactly when the warning matters most.
