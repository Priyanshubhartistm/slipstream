  // every fill with `sequence > 0`, i.e. the ENTIRE 4096-entry ring including
  // months of fills that L1 settled long ago, and replays them into a position
  // that does not exist. Reproduced against live devnet: with the real cursor
  // (44189) every wallet correctly reconstructs to null; with the cursor
  // defaulted to 0 one wallet renders a pending LONG 5.600 SOL @ $73.09, and
  // the "Close" button beside it is live — one click sends a real 5.6 SOL IOC
  // and opens genuine opposite exposure.
  //
  // Without the cursor the client cannot tell a settled fill from a pending
  // one, so the only honest output is nothing at all. `market` is null while
  // the Market read is still in flight, when the account is genuinely absent,
  // and when the base layer is unreachable; all three mean "no cursor", and
  // all three must show no pending row rather than a fabricated one.

  // window is currently the whole ring and L1 settlement cannot advance the
  // head, so it filters nothing.
  //
  // The shared cursor is up to 5s old rather than the 2s of the private poller
  // this replaced, so a just-settled fill can linger as "pending" for a few

  // disagree, and erring towards "still pending" never invents exposure.
