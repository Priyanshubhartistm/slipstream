// pm2 ecosystem for the SlipStream keepers + market-maker (production box).
// Each is a long-running tsx process. --env-file loads keepers/.env
// (BASE_RPC / ER_RPC / KEEPER_KEYPAIR / DEPLOY_MANIFEST) into process.env.
//
// Usage (from keepers/):  pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
//
// Log rotation: the out_file/error_file paths below grow unbounded on their
// own — pm2 does not rotate app logs by default. Install pm2's own log
// rotation module ONCE per box (not per-app, no ecosystem.config.js change
// needed):
//   pm2 install pm2-logrotate
//   pm2 set pm2-logrotate:max_size 50M
//   pm2 set pm2-logrotate:retain 14
// For the SQLite fills indexer (keepers/data/fills.db, separate from these
// logs), see INDEXER_RETENTION_DAYS in .env.example.
