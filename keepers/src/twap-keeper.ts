/**
 * BUG 3 fix: do not send a crank the program is certain to reject.
 *
 * crank_twap gates on the ORACLE's own publish time against the on-chain clock
 * (`oracle::MAX_STALENESS_SECS` = 60s, see programs/slipstream/src/oracle.rs:22
 * and crank_twap.rs's `reading.is_fresh(now_ts)`), so a crank sent while Pyth is
 * stale fails preflight with custom program error 0x104 / OracleStale. That
 * costs no lamports -- simulation rejects it before it lands -- but it counted
 * as a keeper error, and 11 of them tripped the 60s backoff below.
 *
 * That backoff was the actual damage. The devnet Pyth feed
 * (7UVimffxr9ow1uXYxsr4LHAcV58mLzhmwaeKvJ1pjLiE) no longer publishes
 * continuously: measured 2026-09-04 it published twice in 200s, 309s apart, and
 * read fresh in only 9 of 40 samples. So the usable window is ~60s out of every
 * ~300s, and a keeper that spends 88s failing and then sleeps 60s drifts in and
 * out of phase with those windows -- it cranked ZERO times in 13 minutes while
 * the feed published three times.
 *
 * Reading the feed first turns each doomed send into a cheap skip, which keeps
 * the loop in phase and lets it crank on the first poll after every publish.
 * The margin reserves part of the 60s for send + confirm, since freshness is
 * re-evaluated on-chain at execution, not at send.
