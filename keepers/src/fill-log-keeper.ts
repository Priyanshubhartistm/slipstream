 * fill-log settlement keeper — the settlement pipeline that actually lands ER
 * fills as L1 Positions, WITHOUT ever committing the 612 KB OrderBook.
 *
 * Pipeline each tick:
 *   1. mirror_fills  (ER): copy new OrderBook fills into the small FillLog.
 *   2. commit_fill_log (ER): flush the FillLog to L1 (each commit consumes 1 of
 *      the account's 10 sponsored commits — proven empirically).
 *   3. settle_from_log (L1): read the committed FillLog and write Positions.
 *
 * EPOCH ROTATION: the sponsored-commit cap is a hard 10 PER delegated account
 * (verified live on two fresh accounts). When the current FillLog nears 10
 * commits, the keeper initializes + delegates the NEXT epoch's FillLog (a fresh
 * PDA with its own fresh 10) and rolls over. Settlement is therefore continuous;
 * old epoch logs are drained then abandoned (each ~8 KB, trivial devnet rent).
