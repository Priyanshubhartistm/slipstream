 * the keyed provider it pointed at returned
 *   HTTP 429 {"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32429,"message":"max usage reached"}}
 * on every call, and five keepers -- twap, funding, liquidation, taker and
 * market-maker, i.e. every caller of getBaseConnection() -- sat in a retry loop
 * for 2.7 days while the free public endpoint answered 200 in ~200 ms the whole
 * time. expiry-keeper never calls this and was the only one that stayed up.
 *
 * The frontend's /api/rpc/[layer] route had already grown this failover; the
 * keepers had not, so the browser degraded and the fleet died. This closes that
 * asymmetry at the one chokepoint every long-running keeper shares.
 *
 * The default is deliberately the FREE public endpoint rather than a second
 * key: it throttles under load, but it is always there, and a slow chain read
 * beats a dead keeper.
